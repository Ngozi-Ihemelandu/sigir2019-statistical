Several thousand temporary files are generated in the process and stored in directory `scratch/`. They correspond to the marginal distributions, copulas and p-values. They are not versioned in this repository for being too many or too big, but ZIP archives are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/julian-urbano/sigir2019-statistical/releases/tag/scratch).

* `01-margins.zip` contains all marginal distributions.
* `02-margins_transform.zip` contains all transformed marginal distributions.
* `03-bicop.zip` contains all bivariate copulas.
* `11-type_1.zip` contains all p-values under the null hypothesis.
* `12-type_2.zip` contains all p-values under the alternative hypothesis.
